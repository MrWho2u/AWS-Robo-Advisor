# Background
We’ve been hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country. They want to increase their client portfolio—especially by engaging young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, you decide to create a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

# What's Been Created
Using AWS and Python to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

AWS uses the following tasks:
+ A defined Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.
+ Bot that accurately responds during the conversation with the user.
+ An enhanced Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation.
